# Burger-Restaurant

This application uses a database to store information entered by the user and modify by clicking buttons on the screen. The user can enter the name of a burger and add it to the list of burgers ready to be eaten. When they click the 'devour it' button, that burger will be modified in the database and show up in the list of burgers that have already been enjoyed.
